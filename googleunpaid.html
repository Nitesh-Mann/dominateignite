                      We employ other companies and individuals to perform
                      functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling
                      orders for products or services, delivering packages,
                      sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive

                      transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing
                      credit risk, and providing customer service. These
                      third-party service providers have access to personal
                      information needed to perform their functions, but may not

                    <p>
                      As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
                      buy other businesses or services. In such transactions,
                      customer information generally is one of the transferred
                      business assets but remains subject to the promises made
                      in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
                      customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                      that Dominate Ignite or substantially all of its assets
                      are acquired, customer personal information will of course
                      be one of the transferred assets.

                      rights, property, or safety of Dominate Ignite, our users,

              </h4>
              <p>
                At Dominate Ignite, we understand how frustrating it can be when
                your Google Ads account is suspended due to unpaid balance
                issues. A suspended account can bring your business operations
                to a halt, leading to revenue loss, decreased online visibility,
                and disruption in your marketing strategy. If you are facing
                this issue, our Google Unpaid Balance Suspension Service is here
                to help you reinstate your account efficiently and securely.

              <h4>Why Does Google Suspend Accounts Due to Unpaid Balances?</h4>
              <p>
                Google enforces strict payment policies to ensure advertisers
                comply with their financial obligations. A Google Ads unpaid
                balance suspension can occur due to the following reasons:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Missed or Late Payments</b>
                  <p>
                    If your account has outstanding balances from previous ad
                    campaigns that were not paid on time, Google may suspend
                    your account until the amount is cleared.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Payment Method Issues</b>
                  <p>
                    Google may suspend your account if there is an issue with
                    your payment method, such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Expired credit card</li>
                    <li>Insufficient funds</li>
                    <li>Payment declined by your bank</li>
                    <li>Invalid billing details</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Policy Violations Related to Payments</b>
                  <p>
                    Repeated failures to settle dues or attempts to bypass
                    Google’s payment system may trigger a policy violation,
                    leading to a suspension.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Linked Account Suspensions</b>
                  <p>
                    If another Google Ads account linked to yours has unpaid
                    balances, your account may also face suspension as part of
                    Google's enforcement actions.
                  </p>
