                      functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling
                      orders for products or services, delivering packages,

                      As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
                      buy other businesses or services. In such transactions,

                      business assets but remains subject to the promises made
                      in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
                      customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                      that Dominate Ignite or substantially all of its assets
                      are acquired, customer personal information will of course
                      be one of the transferred assets.

                Get Your Google Merchant Center Account Reinstated with Dominate

              </h4>
              <p>
                At Dominate Ignite, we understand how critical Google Merchant
                Center is for your eCommerce business. When your account gets
                suspended, it can directly impact your sales, revenue, and
                overall online presence. That’s why we specialize in Google
                Merchant Center account unsuspension services—helping businesses
                resolve policy violations and regain their ability to advertise
                on Google Shopping.

              <h4>Understanding Google Merchant Center Suspension</h4>
              <p>
                Google Merchant Center suspensions typically occur due to policy
                violations, incorrect business details, or misrepresentation
                issues. The suspension notification may provide some guidance,
                but resolving it requires expert knowledge of Google’s policies
                and compliance requirements.

              <h3>Common Reasons for Google Merchant Center Suspension</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <h5><b>Misrepresentation of Products or Business</b></h5>
                  <p>
                    Providing misleading information about products, pricing, or
                    services can lead to account suspensions. Common issues
                    include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Providing misleading information about products, pricing,
                      or services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Listing out-of-stock or unavailable products.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5><b>Violation of Google’s Shopping Ads Policies</b></h5>
                  <p>
                    Google enforces strict policies regarding the types of
                    products that can be advertised. Violations include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Selling prohibited products (e.g., weapons, counterfeit
                      items, or restricted content).
                    </li>
                    <li>Including misleading promotions or false claims.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5><b>Unclear Business Identity</b></h5>
                  <p>
                    A lack of transparency about your business can lead to
                    policy violations. Issues include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Incomplete or missing contact details (phone number,
                      business address, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Unverified website ownership or missing essential pages
                      like privacy policy and terms of service.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5><b>Pricing & Checkout Discrepancies</b></h5>
                  <p>
                    Inconsistencies between product listings and checkout pages
                    can trigger policy violations. Key concerns include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Mismatch between product prices listed on Google Shopping
                      and those on your website.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unexpected additional fees at checkout.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5><b>Poor Website Experience</b></h5>
                  <p>
                    A slow, unsecured, or unresponsive website can negatively
                    impact both user experience and compliance. Issues include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Non-responsive or slow-loading websites.</li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of proper security measures (SSL certificates, secure
                      payment options, etc.).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If your Google Merchant Center account is suspended, the first
                step is to identify the issue, fix violations, and submit a
                strong appeal—this is where Dominate Ignite comes in!

                        While some issues can be self-fixed, Google’s policies
                        can be complex and difficult to navigate. A small
                        mistake in your appeal or compliance measures can result
                        in a permanent suspension. Our expert team ensures
                        everything is handled correctly.
